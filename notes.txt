SENSORS

    - Touch sensors only work in non-root links.
        â€¢ Not in contact = -1. In contact = 1.


LINKS 

    - If two links are connected by a joint,
    at the beginning of the simulation the angle between them is considered to be zero radians.

    
JOINTS

    # Only the first link in a robot --- the "root" link --- has an absolute position.
    # Every other link has a position relative to its "upstream" joint.
    
    
    # Create the joint for the links. The position should be right where both joints come together.
    # By convention the name should be Parent_Child joint names.
    # BE aware of relative and absolute joint positions.
    # First Joint is always absolute position wrt 1st Link. The rest are relative to this first set.
